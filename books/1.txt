and expenditure on such Consultancy assignments shall be made out of the same. The
Balance Sheet of consultancy account is integrated into the Balance Sheet of General A/c at
the time of finalization of Accounts.
	

b.	 The General Account - Receipts and Payments Account includes Debits of Rs.
16,14,09,775.09 and Credits of Rs. 16,14,09,775.09 pertaining to various projects / other
ledgers. This is on account of re-classification of receipt / payment pertaining to current/
prior period in concerned project ledger accounts / other ledgers by passing Journal
Entries. However, these entries do not have effect on actual closing bank balances in the
Receipts and Payments Accounts.

	

c.	 General A/c: Balance Sheet : Sch.1 Capital Grant – Rs.50.82 ­­­­­lakhs needs to be reconciled.

	

d.	 Actuarial valuation of provisioning required for retirement benefits i.e Gratuity, Pensions
and Leave Encashment was conducted through a certified actuary during the financial year

reference is invited to GFRs 2017 Rule No. 230(12)(ii) which stipulates that "Grantee
Institutions or Organisations should be encouraged to take advantage of the pension or
gratuity schemes or Group Insurance Schemes or house buildings loans or vehicle loans
schemes etc. available in the market for employees instead of undertaking liability on
their own or Government account". As the Institute is mainly funded by Ministry of Rural
Development, Govt of India, for all its activities, the Ministry was requested to release
grants separately for funding of the liability for retirement benefits. Reply to the same is
awaited. Hence, pending decision by MoRD on release of funds, the liability on retirement
benefits has not been undertaken/provided for in the books of accounts.

	

e.	 Contingent Liabilities : The Institute has given Bank Guarantee (SBH) of Rs. 616000.00
in connection with Ministry of External Affairs project on Establishing CGARD Technology
Centre at Madgascar. The same has been separately exhibited under General Account :

Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR), Hyderabad, as at 31 March 2017, Income & Expenditure Account
and Receipts & Payment Account for the year ended on that date under Section 20(1) of the

our audit.
2.	 This Separate Audit Report contains the comments of the Comptroller & Auditor General
of India (CAG) on the accounting treatment only with regard to classification, conformity
with the best accounting practices, accounting standards and disclosure norms, etc. Audit
observations on financial transactions with regard to compliance with the Law, Rules &
Regulations (Propriety and Regularity) and efficiency-cum-performance aspects, etc., if any,
are reported through Inspection Reports/CAG’s Audit Reports separately.
3.	 We have conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in India. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidences supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
4.	 Based on our audit, we report that:
i.	 We have obtained all the information and explanations which	 to the best of our knowledge
and belief were necessary for the purpose of our audit;
ii.	 The Balance Sheet, Income & Expenditure Account and Receipts & Payment Account dealt
with by this report have been drawn up in the format approved by Government of India,
Ministry of Finance.
iii.	 In our opinion, proper books of accounts and other relevant records have been maintained
by the Institute as required under Finance Bye-Law 31 of the Institute, in so far as it appears

Revision of Accounts
The Institute revised its accounts for the year 2016-17, based on Audit comments. As a result,
the Liabilities and Assets decreased by ` 23.44 lakh and Surplus increased by ` 0.98 lakh.

91

Annual Accounts 2016-17
A.	 Consolidated Balance Sheet
	

A.1	 Capital & Liabilities

		

A.1.1	 Earmarked Funds: ` 190.91 crore

			

		

A.1.1.1	 This includes an amount of ` 3,67,45,636/- pertaining to “Unclassified
RTGS Receipts” and accounted under Specific Grants for Projects
(Scheudle-L14), representing unreconciled/suspense credits to be
transferred to proper head of accounts/Projects as the purpose for
which these amounts were received were yet to be reviewed. This was
incorrectly treated as Earmarked Funds, instead of accounting under
Current Liabilities & Provisions-Other Liabilities and had resulted in
overstatement of Earmarked Funds and understatement of Current
Liabilities & Provisions by ` 3.67 crore.

A.1.2	 Current Liabilities & Provisions: ` 61.19 crore

			

A.1.2.1 	 This includes closing balance amount of ` 29,95,28,335/- to-wards
Monitoring Fee received by the Institute from MoRD as a percentage out
of the Principal Grants meant for Earmarked Specific Projects (SGSY/
DDU-GKY) and to be spent on specific activities/purposes related to the
monitoring of the sanctioned Specific Projects, which was incorrectly
classified under Current Liabilities instead of as Earmarked Funds,
though mandated as per Uniform Format of Accounts (Page 26). This had
resulted in overstatement of Current Liabilities and understatement of
Earmarked Funds by ` 29.95 crore.

B.	 Consolidated Income and Expenditure Account
	

B.1	 Expenditure - ` 92.76 crore

		 B.1.1	
Asset item of ` 11,65,403/- pertaining to Supply & Installation of 2 Nos.
30KVA Online UPS System procured in December 2016 (less than 6 months
of acquisition), was incorrectly classified under Plant & Machinery by
providing with 15% depreciation (` 87,405/ ) instead of applicable rate of 60%
(` 3,49,621/-) for Computers & Peripherals as per IT Act. Consequently, short
provision of depreciation of ` 2,62,216/- resulted in overstatement of Fixed Assets
and understatement of Expenditure by ` 0.03 crore. Surplus was also overstated
by ` 0.03 crore.
C.	General
	1.	Provision towards Retirement benefits was not made as per Actuarial Valuation though
mandated as per Accounting Standard-15, on the plea of non-receipt of funds for the
provision amount from the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), which was contrary
to the fact that the Non-Plan and Plan Grants (General & Salaries) sanctioned by MoRD
is inclusive of funds for Retirement benefits. Hence, Retirement benefits, which are

92

Annual Accounts 2016-17
deferred salary to the employee should be paid by making due provision every year
based on Actuarial Valuation.
	2.	An amount of ` 5,07,87,298/- pertaining to Inoperative Project funds and an amount of
` 2,68,08,284/- (including SB interest of ` 27,44,538/- earned on the closed projects)
pertaining to closed projects totalling ` 7,75,95,582/- was set off against minus closing
balances of ` 1,57,44,738/- (amounts spent in excess of the Project funds) of the other
closed projects and net balance of ` 6,18,50,844/- was treated as Miscellaneous
receipts and transferred to NIRD&PR, Corpus Fund Account. However, details of
closure reports having sent in respect of these Inoperative and or closed Projects to
MoRD/Funding Agency were not furnished to Audit and specific approval of Ministry was
not obtained for transfer of unspent Project fund balances to Institute’s Corpus Fund.
Further, in respect of the closed projects against which excess amounts were spent
(` 1,57,44,738/-), correspondence was not made with MoRD/Funding Agency for getting
reimbursement of the excess expenditure.
	3.	Architectural Fee charges of ` one lakh paid towards deferred construction work
of Convention Centre in the Institute’s Campus, taken up initially as a part of
Master Plan, yet to be approved by the Ministry, was incorrectly capitalised and
added to Fixed Assets in the Building Fund Account, instead of accounting under
Capital Works-in-Progress. This was not rectified.
D.	Grants-in-aid: Out of total Grants-in-aid of ` 58.83 crore received during the year {Plan: 
` 41.83 crore1, Non-plan: ` 17.0 crore2 together with internal receipts of  ` 16.05 crore and

Revision of Accounts
The Institute revised its accounts for the year
2016-17, based on Audit comments. As a result,
the Liabilities and Assets decreased by ` 23.44
lakh and Surplus increased by ` 0.98 lakh.

No Comments

A. Consolidated Balance Sheet

The comment is regarding the classification between
two heads of account, ‘Earmarked Funds’ and ‘Current
Liabilities and Provisions’, both of which are under
‘Liabilities’ in the Balance Sheet. Hence, there is no impact
on the total Liabilities in the Balance Sheet.

A.1

Capital & Liabilities

A.1.1

Earmarked Funds : ` 190.91 crore

A.1.1.1
This includes an amount of `
3,67,45,636/- pertaining to “Unclassified RTGS
Receipts” and accounted under Specific Grants
for Projects (Scheudle-L14), representing
unreconciled/suspense credits to be transferred to
proper head of accounts/Projects as the purpose
for which these amounts were received were yet
to be reviewed. This was incorrectly treated as
Earmarked Funds, instead of accounting under
Current Liabilities & Provisions-Other Liabilities
and had resulted in overstatement of Earmarked
Funds and understatement of Current Liabilities
& Provisions by ` 3.67 crore.

Inflows into NIRDPR bank accounts comprise mainly
Grants-in-aid from Ministry, Miscellaneous Income,
earmarked funds (which are funds earmarked for specific
purposes/ projects/specific activities) and other refunds/
deposits. Each of the above is classified to the relevant
ledger in accounts as and when it is received/ earned. In
respect of grants, income, refunds/deposits, the nature
and source of inflow is immediately known and the same
is accounted for under the correct heads. However, in the
case of earmarked funds, due to large number of sponsored
projects/­
programmes taken up by the Institute, a small
portion of such funds remain unclassified for sometime
due to late receipt of sanction order/ communica­tion from
the sponsor/ relevant Depart­
ment. Such amounts are
classified to the right head subsequently, on receipt of the
sanction order. This is a routine and continuous process.
The amount of unclassified RTGS receipts mentioned in
the comment (which works out to only 0.39 % of the total
receipts into NIRDPR accounts) pertains to such funds
sanctioned/transferred by the sponsor for specific projects/
purpose and the same have been classified.
Further, by definition, amounts included under current
liabilities should only be those which are to be liquidated
within one financial year. Whereas balances of earmarked
funds like programme/­project funds may spill over to the
next financial year based on the duration of the project.
Hence, including unclassified receipts under current
liabilities is not justified..
Therefore, unclassified receipts are shown under
earmarked funds as has been the practice consistently
followed by the Institute. Further, the above classification
has no impact on Income and Expenditure Account or
the total value of assets/liabilities of the Institute.

96

Annual Accounts 2016-17
A.1.2
Current Liabilities & Provisions:
` 61.19 crore
A.1.2.1 This includes closing balance amount of
` 29,95,28,335/- towards Monitoring Fee
received by the Institute from MoRD as a
percentage out of the Principal Grants meant for
Earmarked Specific Projects (SGSY/DDU-GKY)
and to be spent on specific activities/purposes
related to the monitoring of the sanctioned
Specific Projects, which was incorrectly
classified under Current Liabilities instead of
as Earmarked Funds, though mandated as per
Uniform Format of Accounts (Page 26). This had
resulted in overstatement of Current Liabilities
and understatement of Earmarked Funds by
` 29.95 crore.

The comment is regarding the classification between
two heads of account, ‘Earmarked funds’ and ‘Current
liabilities’, both of which are liabilities. Hence, there is no
impact on the total Liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
DDUGKY project cell of NIRDPR is responsible for
monitoring of various DDUGKY activities across the
country and conducting appraisals, monitoring and
evaluation of the Project Implementation Agencies
executing the projects sanctioned by the Ministry, capacity
building and also research. The amounts released
by the Ministry for the DDUGKY projects comprise
(1) grants released by Ministry to NIRDPR to be further
released to PIAs, which are grouped under the head
‘Earmarked funds’ as they are basically specific funds
received from Ministry for implementation of DDUGKY
projects/programmes/specific activities (Schedule L14 in
the Annual Accounts) and (2) monitoring charges received
as a percentage of grants released. The monitoring
charges are utilised for servicing the DDUGKY cell and
meet the related expenditure on this project. The practice
of treating the monitoring charges as current liability has
been consistently followed by the Institute since inception
of DDUGKY activities in NIRDPR.
Further, the above classifica­tion has no impact on
Income and Expenditure Account or the total value of
assets/liabilities of the Institute.

B. Consolidated Income and Expenditure
Account
B.1 Expenditure - ` 92.76 crore
B.1.1 Asset item of ` 11,65,403/- pertaining to
Supply & Installation of 2 Nos. 30KVA Online UPS
System procured in December 2016 (less than 6
months of acquisition), was incorrectly classified
under Plant & Machinery by providing with 15%
depreciation (` 87,405/-) instead of applicable rate
of 60% (` 3,49,621/-) for Computers & Peripherals
as per IT Act. Consequently, short provision of
depreciation of ` 2,62,216/- resulted in over­
statement of Fixed Assets and understatement
of Expenditure by ` 0.03 crore. Surplus was also
overstated by ` 0.03 crore.
C. General
1. Provision towards Retirement benefits was
not made as per Actuarial Valuation though
mandated as per Accounting Standard-15, on
the plea of non-receipt of funds for the provision
amount from the Ministry of Rural Development
(MoRD), which was contrary to the fact that the
Non-Plan and Plan Grants (General & Salaries)
sanctioned by MoRD is inclusive of funds for
Retirement benefits. Hence, Retirement benefits,

The 30KVA Online UPS System mentioned in the
comment is not the regular UPS for desktop computers
but is the standalone major electrical equipment for ACDC conversion and supporting three phase input -one
phase output model of supply of power for various power
points across the Institute. Hence, it does not come under
‘Computers and Peripherals’ and has been correctly
grouped under Plant and Machinery and depreciated as
per the applicable rates.

Provisioning and funding for retirement benefits is to meet
future liability spanning over a few decades. Grants released
under Plan/Non-Plan by MoRD every year are only to meet
that year’s liability. Hence, provisioning as per actuarial
valuation cannot be made from yearly Plan/Non-Plan grants
from MoRD. Further, grants released under Non-Plan have
been on a continuous decline year after year.
Notwithstanding the above, Actuarial valuation of provision
required for retirement benefits i.e Gratuity, Pensions and
Leave Encashment was conducted through a certified
actuary during the financial year 2016-17. The estimated

97

Annual Accounts 2016-17
which are deferred salary to the employee
should be paid by making due provision every
year based on Actuarial Valuation.

liability as on 30 November 2016 was Rs.98.58 crore
(Gratuity- Rs.14.83 crore, Pensions- Rs. 71.08 crore and
Leave Encashment- Rs.12.67crore). A reference is invited
to GFRs 2017 Rule No. 230(12)(ii) which stipulates that
“Grantee Institutions or Organisations should be encouraged
to take advantage of the pension or gratuity schemes or Group
Insurance Schemes or house buildings loans or vehicle loans
schemes etc., available in the market for employees instead
of undertaking liability on their own or Government account”. 
As the Institute is mainly funded by Ministry of Rural Develop­
ment, Government of India for all its activities, the Ministry has
been requested to release grants separately for funding of the
liability for provisions for retirement benefits. Pending decision
by MoRD on release of funds, the liability on retirement benefits
has not been undertaken/­provided for in the books of accounts.
However, a detailed disclosure has been made in the Notes
on Accounts – S.No. (d) as required in the Uniform Format
of Accounts.

2. An amount of ` 5,07,87,298/- pertaining
to Inoperative Project funds and an amount
of ` 2,68,08,284/- (including SB interest of
` 27,44,538/- earned on the closed projects)
pertaining
to
closed
projects
totalling
` 7,75,95,582/- was set off against minus closing
balances of ` 1,57,44,738/- (amounts spent in
excess of the Project funds) of the other closed
projects and net balance of ` 6,18,50,844/- was
treated as Miscellaneous receipts and transferred
to NIRD&PR, Corpus Fund Account. However,
details of closure reports having sent in respect
of these Inoperative and or closed Projects to
MoRD/Funding Agency were not furnished to
Audit and specific approval of Ministry was not
obtained for transfer of unspent Project fund
balances to Institute’s Corpus Fund. Further,
in respect of the closed projects against which
excess amounts were spent (` 1,57,44,738/-),
correspondence was not made with MoRD/
Funding Agency for getting reimbursement of
the excess expenditure.

The amounts mentioned in the Comment pertain to
sponsored projects, which are paid assignments to the
Institute by the sponsor for specific purposes/projects.
The Institute is entitled to retain the savings from such
projects as internally generated resources, after successful
completion of the same. In a few cases, due to practical
field situations, the project may run into a deficit where
sanctioned budget becomes insufficient and such deficit is
to be met by the Institute.

3. Architectural Fee charges of ` one lakh paid
towards deferred construction work of Convention
Centre in the Institute’s Campus, taken up initially
as a part of Master Plan, yet to be approved by the
Ministry, was incorrectly capitalised and added to
Fixed Assets in the Building Fund Account, instead
of accounting under Capital Works-in-Progress.
This was not rectified.

Architectural Fee for the Convention Center, being professional
fee, is a capital cost as per AS-10 on Accounting for Fixed
Assets. Hence, it is capitalised and categorized under fixed
assets. Approval of Master Plan from the Ministry has no bearing

An in-depth review of the inoperative project funds that
have been inoperative for past five years, was conducted
during the year and reports on the current status of the
projects were called from all the concerned project executing
centres. UCs­
/c­ompleted reports, after completion of the
projects were sent to the sponsor, wherever required as per
the terms and conditions of the sponsored project and no
further demands from the sponsor/no further requirement
was communicated by the sponsor. After several rounds of
deliberations on this issue, and based on the reports from
the Centres, 78 projects that were inoperative were closed.
Hence, based on these reports, orders of the Competent
Authority were taken and amount transferred to Corpus
Fund, as the net balance is treated as internally generated
resources. Since they are sponsored projects and work has
been completed satisfactorily, no further correspondence
is warranted. Moreover, the GFRs enable for maximizing
IGR for making the Institution financially autonomous over
the years. All the supporting documents for the above were
produced to audit.

Grants-in-aid: Out of total Grants-inaid of ` 58.83 crore received during the year
{Plan:  ` 41.83 crore1, Non-plan: ` 17.0 crore2
together with internal receipts of  ` 16.05 crore and
unutilised balance of ` 120.35 crore pertaining
to previous year, totalling ` 195.23 crore, the
Institute utilised a sum of ` 58.77 crore3, leaving
a balance of ` 136.46 crore unutilised as on 31st
March 2017.

The indicated unutilised balance of `120.35 crore
has wrongly included the refunded amount of
` 30.84 crore in December 2015. This is a mistake on the part
of the Audit. The figures stated by the Audit are also incorrect.
The correct position is as follows :
Out of a total Grants-in-aid of ` 58.83 crore received during
the year {Plan: ` 41.83 crore, Non-plan: ` 17.00 crore},
the Institute utilised a sum of ` 62.24 crore (Plan
` 35.63 crore, Non Plan ` 26.61 crore) resulting in deficit of
grants of ` 3.41 crore. The internally generated resources for
the year was `16.05 crore.
As against unutilized balance of Plan Capital Grants of
` 58.21 crore pertaining to previous year along with ` 2.33
crore being interest during the year, the Institute utilised a
sum of ` 0.17 crore. The unutilized Plan Capital Grants as on
31st March 2017 is ` 60.37 crore.

Fixed Assets:

Reply of the Institute
Internal Audit on the accounts of the Institute is not in arrears
since the same was conducted by Internal Audit Wing of O/o Chief
Controller of Accounts /MoRD in April 2012 covering the period from
2009-10 to 2011-12. Further internal audit was again conducted
by the same office in October 2016 for the period from 2013-14 to
2015-16. Necessary system has been put up in place for Internal
Audit of the Institute by a qualified CA.
There is an effective Internal Control Mechanism for monitoring of
sponsored projects.
Progress and balances of all sponsored projects and program funds
are being monitored at DG level on monthly basis. Separate ledgers
are maintained for each sponsored project to ensure budgetary
control and correct accounting.
Regarding closure of projects, as stated in reply to comment under
General – No 2 above, sponsored projects are paid assignments
to the Institute by the sponsor for specific purpose/project. The
Institute is entitled to retain the savings from such projects, after
successful completion of the project. In a few cases, due to practical
field situations, the project may run into a deficit where sanctioned
budget becomes insufficient and such deficit is to be met by the
Institute.
An in-depth review of the completed projects for past five years
was conducted during the year and reports on the current status of
the projects were called from all the concerned project executing
centres. UCs­/­completed reports, after completion of the projects
were sent to the sponsor, wherever required as per the terms and
conditions of the sponsored project and no further demands from the
sponsor/no further requirement was communicated by the sponsor.
After several rounds of deliberations on this issue, and based on
the reports from the Centres, 78 projects that were inoperative were
closed. Hence, based on these reports, orders of the Competent
Authority were taken and amount transferred to Corpus Fund.
Since the projects that are completed in all respects alone
were closed and the balance amount is treated as internally
generated resources and transferred to Corpus Fund, no further
correspondence is warranted in this regard.

Physical verification of fixed assets was
completed for the year 2016-17 and no
discrepancies were noticed in audit.

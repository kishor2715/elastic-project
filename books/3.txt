organisation under the Ministry of Rural
Development, is a premier national centre of
excellence in rural development and panchayati raj.
It builds capacities of development functionaries,
elected representatives, and other stakeholders
through inter-related activities of training, research
and consultancy. Originally established as National
Institute of Community Development in 1958 at
Mussoorie, the Institute was shifted to its Hyderabad
Campus in 1965 and renamed as National Institute
of Rural Development in 1977. Recognising the need
for more focus on strengthening Panchayati Raj
system and Capacity building of PRI functionaries,

Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR) w.e.f December 4, 2013.
The Institute is located in the serene rural
surroundings of Rajendranagar in a campus
extending 174.21 acres about 15 km away from the

ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15

The Institute has the mandate to facilitate
development of rural poor and enhance their quality
of life. Considering the huge and varied challenges
faced in the development of rural poor across the
country, NIRD&PR as an apex Institute has to address
the training and capacity development needs of a
large clientele. Training of development functionaries
and elected representatives is a pre-condition in the
entire rural development process to make the policy
formulation and programmme implementation
effective. The Institute acts as a "think-tank" of
Ministry of Rural Development and undertakes
training and research including action research on
various flagship programmes of the Ministry. The
Institute's services are also available to other
Ministries / Departments of the Central and State
Governments, banking institutions, public and
private sector organisations, civil societies,
Panchayati Raj Institutions and other national and
international agencies connected with rural
development. In more than 50 years of its existence,
NIRD&PR has been playing its own modest but
credible role to facilitate qualitative changes in
programme management through a process of
training, research, action research, consultancy,
information dissemination and information building.
This has enabled the Institute to emerge as the
National Apex Institute in the area of rural
development and Panchayati Raj. Established in 1983
at Guwahati, North-Eastern Regional Centre (NERC)
of NIRD&PR is recognised as a premier organisation
in the field of rural development catering to the
capacity building needs of development
functionaries of the region. During 30 years of its
existence, NERC has developed expertise and



experience in serving the specific training and
research needs of the north-eastern region.

Activities of the Institute

Training
The Institute has been organising training
programmes, workshops, seminars, etc., on themes
relating to rural development and panchayati raj.
NIRD&PR has expertise and good infrastructure to
train senior and middle level development
functionaries engaged in policy formulation,
management and implementation of rural
development programmes.
The focus of these programmes is on the modalities
and mechanisms of programme management with
special reference to process aspects which will help
the developmental professionals to achieve the
expected goals and objectives of the initiatives. The
training programmes are intended to create
knowledge base, develop skills and infuse right
attitudes and values.
The Institute has been enlarging its canvas of training
activities every year in sustained manner and also
has been successful in making them more needbased and focused. The Institute could achieve a very
high rate of satisfaction of participants by evolving
and adopting new training methods and techniques
on continuous basis. Besides, the findings of the
research studies and action research are utilised in
training programmes as training inputs.

Building the training capacities of its link institutions,
i.e. the State Institutes of Rural Development (SIRDs)
and Extension Training Centres (ETCs), is integral to
Institute's mandate. As part of it, 1025 off-campus
and regional programmes were organised at these
institutions during the year. The programmes mainly
focused on flagship programmes of the Ministry of
Rural Development, Government of India. The
Institute is also serving the training requirements of
officials and non-officials of various organisations
and agencies including banks involved in rural
development. About 700 bank officials belonging to
Dena Bank, Punjab National Bank, Vijaya Bank,
Corporation Bank, etc., were trained on various
aspects of rural credit management. Based on
requests received from Ministries and Departments
of Government of India and State Governments, the
Institute has undertaken various training
programmes on themes required by them. The
Institute also organised a number of international
training programmes at the instance of Ministry of
External Affairs, Government of India and others. It
works in close coordination with international
organisations like AARDO, CIRDAP, UN Women, etc.

By organising 1286 programmes, a total of 34722
participants were trained in 2014-15 as against 31640
persons trained in 1130 programmes during the
corresponding period of previous year. During 201415, NIRD&PR organised several workshops, seminars,
symposiums and national consultations and the
deliberations of these were published as reports and
books. Some of them include Flagship Programmes:
Impact and Challenges, Combating Dalit
Marginalisation: Inclusive Growth - towards Future
Strategies, Changing Patterns of Employment
Relations in Rural Labour Markets in India, Labour
Market and Issues of Adivasis in India and Geoinformatics Applications in Rural Development.

improvement of social wellbeing of rural people with
focus on the rural poor and other disadvantaged
groups through research, action research and
consultancy. Research conducted by the Institute is
field-based in nature with emphasis on current rural
development issues. It helps to understand various
grassroots level issues pertaining to rural
development. It also assists in policy formulation for
rural development and forms an important input in
Institute’s training programmes.

Exposure Visits
It is pertinent to mention that during the year, the
inter-institutional collaborations were stepped up
considerably. During the period under reference,
delegations from University of Alberta, Nepal,
Bangladesh and Fiji visited NIRD&PR as part of study
and exposure visits to rural developmental initiatives
in India. Besides, Hon’ble Minister of Panchayati Raj
& Information Technology, Government of Telangana
and Hon’ble Minister for RD&PR, Government of
Manipur visited the Institute and had interactions
with Director General on various aspects of rural
development.

During the year, the Institute conducted several
research studies to identify contemporary problems
and issues pertaining to programme implementation
and to suggest alternative strategies for improving
effectiveness of various programmes and schemes.
The direct approach to tackling development issues
related to the 'quality of life' of the rural poor has
been the focal area of research. The Ministry of Rural
Development places increased importance on the
feedback provided through the research studies
taken up by the Institute.
During 2014-15, NIRD&PR took up 30 new research
studies (research, action research, village adoption
and consultancy). Greater emphasis was placed on
organising regular Study Forum meetings of faculty
to discuss the research study findings and finalise
the research reports.

approach in planning and implementation with local
decision making and participatory evaluation. It is in
fact a process of learning while doing. In order to
further strengthen the action research initiatives of
the Institute for effective implementation of rural
development and poverty alleviation programmes,
emphasis has been given on ‘village adoption’ studies
by adopting villages from the remote and backward
areas of different parts of the country. The Action
Research and Village Adoption studies enable
NIRD&PR faculty members to keep themselves
abreast with grassroot realities and development
challenges. NIRD&PR provides consultancy support
to various international and national organisations
on different development themes. The Institute also
takes up studies on the request of MoRD and other
Central ministries and State departments. Besides,
studies are taken-up in collaboration with State
Institutes of Rural Development and with other
institutions.

Rural Technology Park (RTP)
The Institute has established Rural Technology Park
(RTP) in 1999 to serve as a catalyst for accelerating
wide dissemination of appropriate and affordable
technologies to the rural poor. It aims at enhancing
their livelihoods for improving quality of life thereby
enabling them to move towards sustainable
development. The National Rural Building Centre at
RTP showcases cost-effective models of rural houses
with 40 different technologies, which are applicable
to different geographical regions of rural India. In
addition, Sanitation Park is also established with a
good number of models of individual hygienic toilets
which are affordable by the rural masses. RTP has
also obtained ISO 9001-2008. NIRD&PR is in the
process of establishing Rural Technology Parks in five
African countries, namely, Malawi, Zimbabwe,
Congo, Cote-de-Ivore and South Sudan in a phased
manner under India-Africa Forum Summit-II (IAFS)
of Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India.

international candidates from CIRDAP and AARDO
member countries like Srilanka, Indonesia, Fiji,
Ghana, Bangladesh and Vietnam started in August,
2014. The Ninth batch of the programme
commenced in January 2015.

A Resource Cell for NRLM was established at
NIRD&PR with a view to facilitating capacity building
and research activities for promotion of rural
livelihoods. In order to create awareness and
exposure among officials at district, block and subblock level, the cell organised workshops, seminars
and sessions on concept, objectives, strategies,
framework and operationalisation of NRLM at

21



ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15

During the year, the Institute continued to cater to
the capacity development requirements of
stakeholders, key officials and bank officials involved
in implementation of rural development under
NRLM. With a view to creating awareness and
exposure among stakeholders at district, block and
sub-block level, NIRD&PR organised brainstorming
workshops and consultations on concept, objectives,
strategies, framework and operationalisation of
NRLM through State Institutes of Rural Development
(SIRDs) and other institutions. The focus was on
development of National Level Resource Persons and
Community Resource Persons (CRPs) to facilitate
capacity building with special reference to
operationalisation of farm and non-farm based
enterprises. Other programmes organised during the
year included, Startup Village Entrepreneurship
programmes, evolving guidelines for rural artisans,
national consultation workshops on capacity
building, SHGs and Village Organisations
Management, Promotion of sustainable self-help
groups and federations, review meetings on NRLM,

employment through post-placement tracking,
retention and career progression. Lack of formal
education, marketable skills and other constraints
imposed by poverty place significant entry barriers
to today's job market. DDU-GKY is therefore,
designed not only to provide high quality skill training
opportunities to the rural poor, but also to establish
a larger ecosystem that supports trained candidates
to secure a better future. The design of DDU-GKY,
represents the strategy of the programme aimed at
making rural India a key partner to India's growth
story. DDU-GKY aims to skill rural youth who are poor
and provide them with jobs having regular monthly
wages at or above the minimum wages.
DDU-GKY follows a 3-tier implementation model. The
National Unit at MoRD is the agency responsible for
national policy-making, funding, technical support
and facilitation. The State Skill Missions embedded
in general within the State Rural Livelihood Missions
(SRLMs) and NIRD&PR is envisioned to play a central
role in providing co-funding and implementation
support to DDU-GKY in the State; and the Project
Implementing Agencies (PIAs) implement the
programme through skill training and placement
projects.

Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen
Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY)

NIRD&PR is one of the national level coordinating
agencies for appraisal and monitoring of the DDUGKY projects. At present, NIRD&PR is monitoring 92
Projects which are being implemented by 56 PIAs
across 16 States in India. During the period, 3863
candidates completed their training while 7894 were
under training. In all 1657 candidates were placed.

Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana
(DDU-GKY), the skill training and placement
programme of the Ministry of Rural Development
(MoRD), occupies a unique position amongst skill
training programmes, due to its focus on the rural
poor youth and its emphasis on sustainable

Training Quality Improvement
Measures Committee (T-QIM)

Training Feedback

At the end of each training programme, performance
of training programmes is evaluated through
e-evaluation on a five-point scale with reference to
important components such as training design,
training methods, training materials, speakers’
effectiveness, boarding and lodging facilities, library
facilities, etc., so as to take steps to improve the
training programmes. The overall average score for
the training programmes during 2014-15 was 85 per
cent.

In order to make the training more effective,
measures to improve the qualitative aspects of the
NIRD&PR training programmes have always been the
priority of the Institute. In this regard, a Training
Quality Improvement Measures Committee was
constituted with members drawn from internal and
external subject experts to scrutinise the course
designs and materials and offer suggestive measures.
The Committee meets once in a month and suggests
the required measures for improvement of
programmes to be organised in the ensuing month.

suggestions, the final version of the research report
would emerge. At the time of publication, the
research reports are referred to external subjectexperts for their comments so as to ensure quality
research outcome.

Process of Conducting
Research Studies
A systematic approach is adopted while undertaking
the research studies on various themes identified.
At the initial stage, the faculty members at Centre
level involve in a consultation under the guidance of

presentation, the proposals are referred to Research
Advisory Committee consisting of internal and
external experts for comments and suggestions. The

In all, ten research studies were completed during
the year and the list is presented in Table 1. Since
the span of research projects/studies undertaken
cuts across the financial year, the research projects/
studies completed during the year under reporting
consists of projects/studies either taken up during
the previous years as well as the current year. The
remaining studies, as per their time-frame, were
continuing and the details are presented in Table 2,
which include the studies taken-up in previous year
as well.

revised research proposals are forwarded to
Academic Committee of the Institute for approval.

ACTION RESEARCH AND
VILLAGE ADOPTION
Action research takes the researchers much closer
to the grassroots problems and prospects while
promoting rural development endeavours. Such
endeavour also enriches the knowledge base among
researchers to understand the issues facilitating rural
development processes. Hence, more emphasis has
been placed on this particular category of research
studies by NIRD&PR.

policy recommendations and assesses the outcomes.
The action research projects are people centered and
use participatory tools and techniques to elicit
effective participation.

Action Research aims to facilitate the
operationalisation of decentralised development
process and good governance at local level to ensure
socio-economic transformation. The ‘facilitation’
process encompasses social mobilisation, technology
transfer for productivity enhancement, value
addition, etc., capacity building through training and
non-training functions, networking of local
institutions, social development, participatory
decision making, etc. Action Research is carried out
in project villages as “social laboratories” for effective
learning by participants of the training programmes.
It is taken up in order to test the implementability of

Given the contemporary research outcomes and the
current issues/problems that need immediate
attention, NIRD&PR takes up several themes for
action research. A few of the broad themes during

Action Research Tools and
Techniques

Village Adoption
In order to demonstrate the application of the
models and implementation mechanisms
recommended by the Institute based on research
and action research, the village adoption scheme was
initiated during 2012-13. The scheme also aimed at
promoting capacities of faculty members to facilitate
effective implementation of rural development and
Poverty Alleviation programmes. The action research
initiatives specifically undertaken through Village
Adoption Studies focus principally on the issues of
understanding social dynamics, mobilising
community for collective action; bridging the gap
between development administration and villages;
and facilitate sustainable development. The
endeavour also enables the faculty members to keep
themselves abreast with grassroots realities. Faculty
members are encouraged to adopt villages,
specifically drawn from Backward districts across the
country.

As part of action research, methods like sensitising
the targeted community through personal
interaction, capacity-building and awareness
generation, appropriate skill inculcation and
upgradation, mobilising the community for
participatory action, survey on socio-economic data,
participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques for
data collections, focus group discussions (FGDs),
process documentation, etc., are adopted.

Action Research Studies
Taken up
During the year 2014-15, two formal action research
studies were taken up. The list of on-going formal
action research studies is presented in Table 1.

During the year, action research on “Disaster

On selection of village, the designated faculty
member is encouraged to study the profile of village,
the social and economic profile, etc. With the

with Banking Institutions to adopt villages for social
and economic development of the villages
concerned. The approach was quite successful since
many banking institutions expressed their desire for
the development of villages on participatory
approaches with emphasis on capacity-building,
facilitating financial assistance, etc. NABARD has also
been actively engaged in the exercise. Interactive
meetings with banking institutions and officials from
NABARD were initiated during the year.

New Initiatives under Village
Adoption Studies
Besides encouraging the Institute faculty members
to undertake Village Adoption studies, collaboration
with Bankers through Rural Technology Park was also
initiated. As part of this endeavour, the Rural
Technology Park division took a lead in collaboration

scheme and about the rural technologies that can
be implemented were discussed. Besides, the
participants were exposed to the Units in the Rural
Technology Park. As part of the Workshop, a field
visit was arranged to an Indo-German Watershed
project in a village viz., Sivaru Venkatapuram in
Medak district, in order to acquaint them with the
works and benefits of watersheds in sustainable rural
development.

training programmes at RTP and supporting them
with the necessary financial assistance for starting
the units. The villages which have shown keen
interest in self-development approach are supported
by NIRD&PR by providing solar street lighting as an

RESTRUCTURING OF NIRD&PR

The capacity building of rural development functionaries and elected representatives of the panchayati raj
Institutions in the field of rural development is of prime importance for better implementation of the rural
development programmes. In order to meet the growing challenges in this field, it has been decided to
constitute a Committee to suggest measures for reform and revamp of the National Institute of Rural
Development and Panchayati Raj, State Institutes of Rural Development (SIRDs) and Extension Training
Centres (ETCs) which are the nodal Institutions engaged in training and capacity building of the rural
development functionaries at National, State and District levels.

Summary of Recommendations of the
Committee
Regarding the vision of NIRD, the
recommendation is to look at the changing
rural scenario with special reference to
urbanisation, change of employment
structure, changes in agriculture, etc., even
while retaining the old focus on poverty,
inequality and natural resource management.
The Vision has to be influenced by the
changing institutional context in the form of
SHG networks and PRIs and the inflow of new
technologies of rural areas. Further the rightsbased framework needs to be an operational
philosophy.
NIRD should be a hub in a national network of
related institutions focusing on capacity
building, research, knowledge creation and
policy advocacy.
The Committee recommended the following
objectives related to the Training and Research
of NIRD:
i.

To serve as a national hub of knowledge
connectivity for Rural Development by



134



ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15

where networking of institutional-mix is
not feasible because of non-availability
of the requisite infrastructure and skills
at present.
4)

NIRD may be re-structured into six Schools
having Centres within each school. Each school
is to be headed by a Dean and each Centre by
a Chairperson. Both the positions would have
fixed single terms of two years extendable to
three years if required. The Centre should have
a minimum of 3 faculty members with at least
one Professor / Associate Professor / Assistant
Professor. In addition, there could be Research
Associates, Consultants, visiting Faculty,
Interns, Research Scholars, Post-Doctoral
Fellows. The Chairmanship will rotate on the
basis of seniority among Professors. Broadly,
the Centers could be on basic disciplines and
in applied areas. It is recommended that the
functioning of the Centres and Schools should
evolve gradually and not rushed through and
it needs a mentoring process. The illustrative
list of schools is as given below:
1.

School of Development Studies & Social
Justice

2.

School of Rural Management &
Livelihood Studies

3.

School of Public Policy & Habitat Studies

4.

School of Global Studies in Rural
Development (New Proposed)

5.

School of Science, Technology and
Information Studies

6.

School of Media and Cultural Studies



Each School should have appropriate Centres which
need to be worked out based on availability of staff
and their specialisation. Each school should be
supported by a School Board consisting of the Dean,
Chairs of all the Centres and three external experts
nominated by the Director General. The School Board
should meet at least twice a year to approve the
training calendar and other academic programmes.
Also to provide secretarial and logistical support,
each school should have a Secretariat by redeploying
support.
5)

The General Council needs to be re-structured.
The Committee recommended for change in
the composition of the General Council and
suggested for increase in the number of
representatives of institutions working in rural
development fields, eminent persons having
made noteworthy contribution in the field of
rural development of Central ministries and
departments, etc.

6)

The Committee recommended for change in
the composition of EC and suggested for
increase in the number of representatives of
the EC and indicated the institutions and
organisations from which additional members
can be represented.

7)

The Committee recommended a Committee
of Direction to mentor the changes
recommended by the Committee.

8)

The Committee recommended a Facilitation
